Tutorial: Introducing Cimba
===========================

Preliminaries
-------------

First, you need to obtain the source code and build the Cimba library. Cimba is
only distributed as source code through the Github repository at
https://github.com/ambonvik/cimba

You will need ``git``, ``meson``, and a C compiler like ``gcc`` or ``clang```.
We also recommend a modern integrated development environment (IDE) like CLion,
which has the advantage of being available both on Linux and Windows, integrated
with a ``gcc`` toolchain (called MinGW under Windows), and free for open source
work. Microsoft Visual Studio with MVSC should also work, but we have not tested
it yet.
